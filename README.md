The visualization project aims to assist job seekers, such as students looking for part-time work, fresh graduates, underemployed, and unemployed individuals.  This demographic consists of people who are either canvassing career paths/options or searching for job opportunities that fit their needs.

LinkedIn is a common tool utilized by job seekers to look for employment opportunities.  However, depending on the user’s familiarity with LinkedIn’s functions, they may find it difficult to ascertain if certain job postings are the best options available to them or if these postings are competitive by industry or location standards.  They may struggle to find accurate and comprehensive salary insights when evaluating career opportunities as it requires them to manually search and compare job listings.  It becomes difficult for them to analyze and compare salary trends effectively. 
An interactive dashboard would address this issue as it will effectively visualize salary data, which can enable users to:
- Explore salary distribution across different industries, skill sets, companies, and locations
- Compare salaries by industry, skill set, company, and location
